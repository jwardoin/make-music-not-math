        Whether you like it or not, every time you make money on a gig, teaching
        a lesson, or selling an album, that is considered <em>income</em> by the
        IRS and thus is subject to income tax laws. In most cases, this income
        will be classified as self-employed or contract income; this means that
        on top of paying income tax, you are also subject to paying the full
        amount for FICA tax (Social Security and Medicare).
